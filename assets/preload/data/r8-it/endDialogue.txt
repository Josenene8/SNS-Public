:pump:default:Hmmm? Oh, there you are! And I see you have your friend too!! Hello!
:gf:question:Oh hey dad one. What’re you doin’ here?
:pump:question:I came as soon as I got the call for a ride! Though I must say this spot is quite unusual. Were you two singing again all the way out here?
:bf:embarrased:Yeah pops, something like that. I think we’d just like a lift if you don’t mind…
:pump:happy:Of course, of course! You’re in luck, BF’s friend, for this shall be your first time aboard the magic limo!
:gf:question:The wha?
